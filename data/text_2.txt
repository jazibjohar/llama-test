Maria Garcia (Project Manager):
Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining. We’re here to discuss the migration project for moving our workloads from Azure to AWS. This is a crucial step for the business, and we need to align on strategy, timeline, risks, and the potential financial impacts. I’d like to start with an overview of where we are in the planning phase.

Sarah Mitchell (Senior Engineering Manager):
Sure, Maria. From an engineering perspective, we’ve already completed the initial assessment of our current environment in Azure. We have a range of services—compute resources, databases, storage, and some managed services like Azure Functions. The challenge is moving everything without significant downtime or disruptions to our customers.

James Turner (Cloud Architect):
That’s right. We’re looking at a hybrid approach to start. For instance, we’ll need to migrate some VMs from Azure to AWS EC2, but the complexity comes with the databases—specifically the SQL workloads that are running in Azure SQL. Migrating that to RDS isn’t straightforward, and there’s also the question of how to handle networking between Azure and AWS during the transition.

Rita Collins (Senior DevOps Engineer):
We’re going to need to set up a solid CI/CD pipeline in AWS from the start, especially for the microservices that are running in containers. We’re using Azure Container Service right now, but we’ll be moving to ECS or EKS in AWS. That transition needs careful coordination because we don’t want to break our deployment cycles.

Maria Garcia (Project Manager):
Got it. So we’re dealing with compute, storage, networking, and services like container orchestration. James, how do you see the migration phases unfolding? Do we start with a lift-and-shift, or are we planning for a more granular migration?

James Turner (Cloud Architect):
I think we’ll need a hybrid approach initially. Some of the simpler services, like static file storage, can be moved to S3 relatively quickly. However, for more complex services like our databases and VM-based workloads, we’ll need a more phased migration to avoid unnecessary risk. We’re estimating a two-phase approach—first to migrate non-critical workloads, then tackle the more critical services after thorough testing.

David Lee (CFO):
That brings me to one of my concerns—the financial impact. A phased migration makes sense in theory, but the reality is that we’ll have dual costs during the transition. We'll have ongoing costs in Azure while we move to AWS, and that could add up quickly. How are we managing these costs? What’s the expected budget for the full migration?

Maria Garcia (Project Manager):
That’s a key point, David. From what we’ve seen in initial estimates, we’ll need to account for the dual infrastructure running in both clouds for a few months. James, how do you see the cost implications for running these resources concurrently?

James Turner (Cloud Architect):
It’s definitely going to be costly. I think the most expensive part will be the networking between Azure and AWS. There’s also the licensing cost for things like SQL Server and other enterprise-level software we’re using in Azure, which we’ll have to manage carefully when migrating. We’re estimating about a 10% increase in costs during the migration phase, which could extend to 6-9 months depending on how quickly we move.

Tom Roberts (COO):
From an operational perspective, I’m worried about the downtime. Some of our systems are mission-critical, and we can’t afford extended outages. What’s the risk of downtime during migration, and how do we mitigate it?

Rita Collins (Senior DevOps Engineer):
The biggest risk for downtime is when we cut over our live databases. That’s a potential showstopper if we don’t manage it properly. We’re going to have to have live replication running between Azure SQL and AWS RDS for a period. During that window, we’re looking at a potential 4-6 hour downtime if we have to switch everything over in one go.

Sarah Mitchell (Senior Engineering Manager):
One option to minimize that downtime is to do a “blue-green” deployment where we keep the old system running until the new one is stable and fully verified. But even that comes with a risk—especially if we miss some edge cases in testing. We’ll need to have our QA team involved at every stage to ensure smooth operations.

David Lee (CFO):
Let’s talk about the financial risks. While the dual running costs are one concern, the other is that if we have too much downtime, there could be revenue loss. If we go beyond that 6-hour downtime window, even 30 minutes, that could mean lost transactions, unhappy customers, and potentially penalties in some of our service agreements. We need to understand the impact and build in some contingency in the budget.

James Turner (Cloud Architect):
We’ve considered that, David. We’re exploring ways to reduce the downtime window. If we can split the migration into smaller chunks and do it during off-peak hours, we could limit customer impact. But we have to account for potential delays as well—so we’re padding our timeline by about 3 weeks to ensure we have time for troubleshooting.

Maria Garcia (Project Manager):
I think we should also keep some financial buffer in the budget, especially for unforeseen circumstances. If the migration takes longer than expected, we don’t want to be scrambling for approvals or re-negotiating terms mid-project. Let’s plan for a 15% contingency in both time and cost, just to be safe.

Tom Roberts (COO):
That makes sense. And in terms of staffing, do we have the right resources allocated? This is a massive project, and we need to ensure we have the right people in place for every phase.

Sarah Mitchell (Senior Engineering Manager):
We’re pulling in people from different teams for the migration effort—DevOps, security, QA, and infrastructure. But we’ll need to scale up temporarily. I’d recommend that we bring in a few contract engineers to supplement the team, especially on the networking side. That’s going to be the most complex part of the migration.

Alex Chen (Director of Cloud Infrastructure):
I agree. Also, we need to ensure that we have a strong focus on security throughout this migration. Every step needs to be tested for compliance, especially when dealing with customer data. I think it would be prudent to get our security team involved early on in the process.

Maria Garcia (Project Manager):
Absolutely. I’ll make sure that we loop in the security team. Now, before we wrap up, does anyone have additional concerns or suggestions?

David Lee (CFO):
One more financial point: Have we factored in the costs for retraining staff on AWS? We’ll need to get everyone up to speed, and that could impact productivity during the migration phase as well.

Rita Collins (Senior DevOps Engineer):
That’s a valid concern. We’ll need AWS-specific training for the DevOps team, at least, and we’ll likely need to do some knowledge transfer from Azure to AWS. We’re also looking at AWS support plans, which will be an additional cost, but worth it for the support during the initial months of migration.

James Turner (Cloud Architect):
On that note, I’d recommend we have some AWS experts available during the migration, just to ensure we’re following best practices and not hitting any roadblocks with services we haven’t used before.

Maria Garcia (Project Manager):
Great points, everyone. I’ll take note of these and work with the financial team to update the budget and timeline. I’ll also begin the procurement process for additional resources where needed.

Tom Roberts (COO):
Let’s move quickly on the next steps, then. We’ll need a more detailed plan by the end of next week, including risk management strategies. I’ll make myself available if anyone needs executive approval on anything.

David Lee (CFO):
I’ll review the updated budget and timeline by the end of the week. Let’s make sure we stay within the approved limits but also build in enough flexibility to handle unexpected costs.

Maria Garcia (Project Manager):
Sounds good. I’ll schedule another meeting for next week to check in on progress and align on the final details. Thanks, everyone.

Tom Roberts (COO):
Thanks, everyone. Let's stay aligned and keep communication open.
